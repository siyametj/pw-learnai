# pw-learnai

A modular, open-source library of ideas, frameworks, and interactive tools for applied AI strategy and AI-assisted software development. Built by [Protocol Wealth LLC](https://protocolwealth.io). MIT-licensed. No certificate. No paywall. No marketing funnel.

## What this is

A library of **self-contained modules** you can read, fork, remix, or drop into an AI notebook (NotebookLM, Claude Projects, ChatGPT custom GPTs) for your own learning. Each module is a pair:

- A `module.md` file — the ideas in prose, with falsifiable claims, worked examples, and exercises
- Optional `.jsx` interactive components — calculators, diagnostics, decision tools you can run locally or embed

Pick the modules you want. Ignore the rest. Nothing here assumes you take them in order.

## What this is not

- Not a course. There is no enrollment, no grading, no certificate.
- Not a training program with a fixed path. The modules are deliberately independent.
- Not a product. Nothing here sells Protocol Wealth services.
- Not a complete map of the field. It is a library of the ideas we have found useful and wish we had encountered earlier.

## Module index

Each module is self-contained. Start anywhere.

### Strategy and judgment

| # | Module | Core question |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 01 | [Reading Disruption](modules/01-reading-disruption/module.md) | How do you tell real disruption from incumbent-friendly change? |
| 02 | [The AI Advantage Matrix](modules/02-ai-advantage-matrix/module.md) | Where does AI create durable advantage vs a race to the floor? |
| 03 | [Where AI Destroys Value](modules/03-ai-value-destruction/module.md) | What are the failure modes that look like wins in the short run? |
| 05 | [Platform Economics](modules/05-platform-economics/module.md) | When is an opportunity actually a platform, and when is it a product with an API? |
| 09 | [AI Judgment Under Uncertainty](modules/09-ai-judgment/module.md) | How do you make AI decisions when the capability curve keeps moving? |

### Organization and delivery

| # | Module | Core question |
|---|--------|---------------|
| 06 | [Organizational Design for Continuous Change](modules/06-organizational-design/module.md) | How do you structure for exploration without starving the core? |

| 13 | [Designing Agent Instructions](modules/13-agent-instructions/module.md) | What makes a CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md one a coding agent actually follows, not decoration? |

## Protocol Wealth OSS Labs

The labs connect the learning library to Protocol Wealth's open-source starting points.

| Lab | Source repo | Core question |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| [Nexus Core Lab](labs/protocol-wealth-oss/nexus-core-lab.md) | [`Protocol-Wealth/nexus-core`](https://github.com/Protocol-Wealth/nexus-core) | How do MCP tools expose public, read-only financial analysis without carrying client identity? |
| [PWOS Core Lab](labs/protocol-wealth-oss/pwos-core-lab.md) | [`Protocol-Wealth/pwos-core`](https://github.com/Protocol-Wealth/pwos-core) | How do PII boundaries, audit trails, and confirmation gates become structural controls? |
| [PWPlan Core Lab](labs/protocol-wealth-oss/pwplan-core-lab.md) | [`Protocol-Wealth/pwplan-core`](https://github.com/Protocol-Wealth/pwplan-core) | How do you make a planning compute plane PII-free by construction? |

## How to use this library

### As a reader

Clone the repo or read the files on GitHub. Each `module.md` is complete on its own.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Protocol-Wealth/pw-learnai.git
cd pw-learnai
```

### With NotebookLM (or Claude Projects, or a custom GPT)

The `notebooklm/` directory contains pre-assembled bundles — concatenated markdown files grouped by theme — that you upload directly as sources.

```bash
# Upload any file from notebooklm/ as a NotebookLM source
ls notebooklm/
```

Or roll your own bundle:

```bash
# Combine the strategy modules into one source file
cat modules/01-*/module.md modules/02-*/module.md modules/03-*/module.md > my-strategy-bundle.md
```

### With Codex CLI or Claude Code

Module 12 is now written around practical terminal workflows for Codex CLI and Claude Code. This repo also includes lightweight agent guidance files:

- `AGENTS.md` for Codex and other agents that read the emerging shared convention
- `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, importing `AGENTS.md` so guidance stays in one place

Useful starting prompts:

```bash
codex "Read AGENTS.md and summarize how to update a module safely."
claude --permission-mode plan
```

Useful OSS lab prompts:

```bash
codex "Read labs/protocol-wealth-oss/README.md and propose the smallest safe lab enhancement."
claude --permission-mode plan "Read the PWOS Core lab and propose a client-only confirmation-gate simulator improvement."
```

### PR hygiene across the OSS surface

Audit open PRs across `pw-learnai`, `nexus-core`, `pwos-core`, and `pwplan-core`:

```bash
npm run pr:audit
```

Merge only PRs classified as clean, non-draft, check-passing, and not review-blocked:

```bash
npm run pr:mergeable
```

### With the interactive components

**Use them in your browser** — no install required:

→ **https://protocol-wealth.github.io/pw-learnai/**

The interactive tools (MCP planner, PII guard simulator, confirmation gate simulator, planning contract validator, CLI coding playbook, prompt evaluator, agent instructions auditor, disruption diagnostic, advantage matrix, pre-mortem, assumption ranker) run client-side. No login. No telemetry. No external API calls. Each session evaporates when you close the tab — fill in, screenshot if useful, leave.

Or run them locally:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Or copy any `.jsx` file in `components/interactive/` into your own project. They are deliberately written as single-file components with no private dependencies.

### As a remix target

Fork the repo. Edit the modules to fit your industry. Submit a PR if you want your work upstreamed, or keep it in your fork — that's what MIT is for.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. The bar is specific:

- **Falsifiable claims over fluent ones.** A claim that could describe the opposite outcome does not count.
- **Artifacts over essays.** If you submit a new module, include at least one exercise producing something the reader could show another human.
- **Honesty about limits.** State what the module does not cover and where its reasoning breaks down.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the submission template and review criteria.

## License

[MIT](LICENSE). Use commercially, fork it, rename it, strip our name off. The only ask: if the module helped you, send a PR with what you learned.

## Who built this and why

Protocol Wealth LLC is an SEC-registered RIA that does its own engineering. We built this library because the AI-strategy content available when we started was either expensive and generic (big-name university certificates) or free and shallow (blog posts and LinkedIn slop). We wrote what we wished we had. Keeping it open-source is how we make sure the next person does not have to re-derive it.

Maintainer: [Nicholas Rygiel](https://github.com/rivendale) — Managing Partner / CTO / CISO, Protocol Wealth LLC.

## Acknowledgments

This library draws on work by Clayton Christensen, Rita McGrath, Geoffrey Parker, Marshall Van Alstyne, Charles O'Reilly, Michael Tushman, and a generation of practitioners who wrote honestly about what worked and what did not. Where a specific idea traces to a specific source, it is cited in the module's `references.md`.
